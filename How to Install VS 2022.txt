   - Secrets management

2. Azure Integration
   - Service principal setup
   - Azure credentials management
   - Environment configuration

### Hands-on Tasks
1. Create deployment workflow
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy Azure Function
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Setup .NET Core
         uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1
         with:
           dotnet-version: '6.0.x'
       - name: Build
         run: dotnet build --configuration Release
       - name: Deploy to Azure
         uses: Azure/functions-action@v1
         with:
           app-name: your-function-app-name
           publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
   ```

2. Implement staged deployments
   - Development environment
   - Staging environment
   - Production environment

## Module 4: Octopus Deploy Integration (Week 4)
### Deployment Concepts
1. Octopus Deploy Basics
   - Projects and environments
   - Deployment processes
   - Variables and scoping

2. Azure Integration
   - Octopus Deploy tentacles
   - Azure account setup
   - Package management

### Hands-on Tasks
1. Configure Octopus Deploy
   - Set up Octopus server
   - Create deployment project
   - Configure environments

2. Create deployment process
   - Package Azure Function
   - Set up variable substitution
   - Configure deployment steps

## Final Project (Week 5)
### Requirements
Build a complete CI/CD pipeline for an Azure Function App that:
1. Implements multiple function triggers
2. Uses dependency injection
3. Includes unit tests
4. Deploys through multiple environments
5. Implements proper monitoring

### Deployment Options
1. GitHub Actions Pipeline
   - Build and test
   - Package creation
   - Multi-stage deployment
   - Environment approvals

2. Octopus Deploy Process
   - Package management
   - Environment promotion
   - Configuration management
   - Rollback procedures

I've created a comprehensive 5-week learning plan that covers both development and deployment aspects of Azure Functions. The plan is structured to progress from basic concepts to advanced implementation, with hands-on tasks throughout.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular module or provide more specific examples for any of the sections?
